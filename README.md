# python-pool-game

A pool game I made in python using the pygame module.

Controls
-left click to place the cue ball on the table
-right click to bring the cue ball back to the mouse position
-aim with the line (ball will go towards the line)
-right click to release the ball (speed is determined by the length of the line)
-press enter at any time to restart the game
